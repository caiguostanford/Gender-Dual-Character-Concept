# Gender-Dual-Character-Concept
Project examining whether gender concepts are viewed as dual-character concepts.

Study 3b and 4b ("society" version) are mentioned but not reported in the paper. 

We uploaded all materials that we generated. For materials that were used in the Knobe et al. (2013) studies, please ask the original authors for the specific materials as we do not have the right to share their materials. 

We pre-registered Studies 3b (as well as the comparisons between 3a and 3b) and 4a, 4b [see the RMD file titled "Study 3b & 4a/b Pre-registration"]
